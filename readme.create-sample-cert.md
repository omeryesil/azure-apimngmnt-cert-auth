- **CER files:** CER file is used to store X.509 certificate. Normally used for SSL certification to verify and identify web servers security. The file contains information about certificate owner and public key. A CER file can be in binary (ASN.1 DER) or encoded with Base-64 with header and footer included (PEM), Windows will recognize either of these layout.

- **PVK files:** Stands for Private Key. Windows uses PVK files to store private keys for code signing in various Microsoft products. PVK is proprietary format.

- **PFX files:** Personal Exchange Format, is a PKCS12 file. This contains a variety of cryptographic information, such as certificates, root authority certificates, certificate chains and private keys. Itâ€™s cryptographically protected with passwords to keep private keys private and preserve the integrity of the root certificates. The PFX file is also used in various Microsoft products, such as IIS.

## Step 1 - Create Certificate Authority Root

```shell
CERT_PASS=abcd1234
```

- Generate ca.pass.key and ca.key files

  ```shell
  openssl genrsa -aes256 -passout pass:${CERT_PASS} -out ca.pass.key 4096
  openssl rsa -passin pass:${CERT_PASS} -in ca.pass.key -out ca.key
  rm ca.pass.key
  ```

- Generate the CA root cert
  when prompted, use whatever you'd like, but i'd recommend some human-readable Organization and Common Name.

  ```shell
  openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out ca.pem
  ```

- Create Cer file from Pem (Azure API Management requries Cer)

  ```shell
  openssl x509 -inform PEM -in ca.pem -outform DER -out ca.cer
  ```


## Create Client Key and CSR

```shell
CLIENT_ID="01-mydevice"
CLIENT_SERIAL=01

openssl genrsa -aes256 -passout pass:${CERT_PASS} -out ${CLIENT_ID}.pass.key 4096
openssl rsa -passin pass:${CERT_PASS} -in ${CLIENT_ID}.pass.key -out ${CLIENT_ID}.key 
rm ${CLIENT_ID}.pass.key

# generate the CSR
# i think the Common Name is the only important thing here. think of it like
# a display name or login.
openssl req -new -key ${CLIENT_ID}.key -out ${CLIENT_ID}.csr

# issue this certificate, signed by the CA root we made in the previous section
openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in ${CLIENT_ID}.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key -set_serial ${CLIENT_SERIAL} -out ${CLIENT_ID}.pem
```

## Bundle the private key & cert for end-user client use

```shell
cat ${CLIENT_ID}.key ${CLIENT_ID}.pem ca.pem > ${CLIENT_ID}.full.pem
```

## Bundle Client Key into PFX File

```shell
openssl pkcs12 -export -out ${CLIENT_ID}.full.pfx -inkey ${CLIENT_ID}.key -in ${CLIENT_ID}.pem -certfile ca.pem
```
